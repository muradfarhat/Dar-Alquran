# Dar-Alquran
This project was a website for the Holy Quran House. The site was an admin page for the teacher to control in his own episode for memorizing the Qurâ€™an, 
and through it he could see the names of the students, their grades,and the parts they had memorized, 
as well as pages for students through which they could know the parts they completed successfully.
